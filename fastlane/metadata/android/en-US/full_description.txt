Sudaku is a constraint-based sudoku assistant that automates the tedious work of propagating logical implications while you solve puzzles.

Define relationships between cells using constraints like alldifferent, one-of, and value elimination. The app handles the mechanical propagation of these rules, letting you focus on the logical reasoning and strategy.

This is not a solver - you remain in full control and are responsible for your own logic.
