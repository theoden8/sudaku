## about

One of the most mechanical things about solving sudoku puzzles is manually choosing the values that are immediately implied as a consequence of risking/setting a cell. This app aims to alleviate this problem, by providing user with a language in which they can express a system of rules, from which autocompletions should be derived.

The system consists of a variety of constraints, such as alldifferent, one-of, and plain value elimination, which can be specified individually.

## why not use a solver

This program isn't designed to solve puzzles for you. It isn't designed to ask for your help to solve anything either. It doesn't perform brute-force for you or impose any serious arc consistency. You are still in control of your own logic and victim of your own mistakes.

## tools

* [flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

This is my first mobile application project, and I am being cautious about the language and features.
